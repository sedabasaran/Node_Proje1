# ALOTECH PROJE ÖDEVİ 1  BU REPOSİTORY ÜZERİNDEN İLERLEYECEKTİR. EKSİK BÖLÜMLER BU PROJE ÜZERİNDEN GÜNCELLENECEKTİR.

# LÜTFEN https://github.com/sedabasaran/Node-Proje-server ve https://github.com/sedabasaran/Node-Proje-client ayrı indirmek yerine güncellediğim.

# BU PROJEYİ   https://github.com/sedabasaran/Node_Proje1 PROJESİNİ İNDİRİN. PROJE BURADAN DEVAM EDECEKTİR.


# BU PROJEYİ İNDİRDİKTEN SONRA PROJE DİZİNİNDE 2 TERMİNAL AÇIP, 1. TERMİNALE "cd server " 2. TERMİNALE " cd client " yazıp dizinizi değiştirin. BU ADIMI UYGULADIKTAN SONRA 1.TERMİNALE "npm start " 2.TERMİNALE " npm start " YAZIP ÇALIŞTIRIN. BÖYLECE PROJE " http://localhost:3000/ " ÜZERİNDE ÇALIŞACAKTIR.  


# EĞER 2 TERMİNALEDE " npm start " YAZIP ÇALIŞMAYIP HATA VERDİYSE BÜYÜK İHTİMALLE " package-lock.json " DOSYASI HATA VERİYORDUR. HEM CLİENT SİDE HEM DE SERVER SİDE BÖLÜMÜNDE BULUNAN  " package-lock.json " DOSYASINI SİLİNİZ. SİLDİKTEN SONRA HER 2 TERMİNALE " cd client " TERMİNALİNE VE cd server TERMİNALİNE " npm install " YAZINIZ. BÖYLECE POJE LOCALHOST ÇALIŞACAKTIR.  http://localhost:3000/

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
